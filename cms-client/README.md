# CMS Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install the Angular CLI by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3. Navigate to the repository and enter the cms-client folder.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Run `ng serve` or `npm start`.
6. Visit `localhost:8080`.

Address is subject to change for backend compatibility.

## Using the CLI

You can use the Angular CLI to generate all sorts of useful files and folders. For instance, to generate a component, you could write `ng generate component [componentName]` or use the shorthand notation `ng g c [componentName]`. You may use this feature for directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums and modules.

## Building the Application

Run `ng build --prod` to build the application. The artifacts are stored in `/php/api/client`. You will need to copy all elements inside that folder and paste them to `/php/api`, which is the root of the application.

*Note: E2E and unit testing have been removed to lighten the package.*
